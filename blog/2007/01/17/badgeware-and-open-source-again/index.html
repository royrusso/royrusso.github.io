<div class="entry-content"><p>So the debate continues&hellip; First, Matt Asay dives in on <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/openresource/archives/2007/01/roy_russo_on_op.html">his blog</a>, and now my good friend and former colleague, Andy Oliver, has decided to reply to my blog post on what <a href="http://royrusso.blogspot.com/2007/01/badgeware-and-open-source.html">I see wrong </a>with OSI&rsquo;s stance on badgeware licensing. You can view his post in its entirety <a href="http://blog.buni.org/blog/acoliver/opensource/2007/01/15/Roy-Russo-wrong-on-so-called-badgeware">here</a>. To add fuel to the fire, there&rsquo;s an <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=43851">interesting thread on TSS</a>, regarding MuleSource that has degenerated in to a licensing discussion, and now Matt Asay has <a href="http://asay.blogspot.com/2007/01/and-so-community-rips-itself-apartagain.html">given his opinion</a> on that.  This goes to show exactly how passionate the open source community is, when defending/defining &ldquo;open source&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>On Andy&rsquo;s Blog&hellip;</strong>
I have only the most respect for Andy, having worked with him in the past, and his being a critical member of the early days of JBoss, but&hellip; he&rsquo;s just plain wrong. My telling Andy he&rsquo;s wrong is nothing new, but this time, he&rsquo;s just REALLY wrong. So wrong, in fact, this post is purely dedicated to his twisted view of &ldquo;open source&rdquo; and OSI&rsquo;s stance on badgeware. ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Andy tries to make a point that if most/all libraries used by JBoss required attribution, JBoss would have been unsuccessful as a company. He contends that the sheer amount of screen real-estate would&rsquo;ve crippled any application built on JBoss.</p>

<blockquote><p>If this licensing scheme had taken off in the early days
then, depending on the most prevalent terms regarding UI persistence, I think
JBoss would have been inviable as a company and Alfresco would have never been a
customer. In fact, forget the amount of screen real estate. Some &ldquo;exhibit B&rdquo;
licenses are requesting SPECIFIC screen real estate. If that happened then it
would have been inviable to create aggregate works using two packages which use
the same licenses.</p></blockquote>

<p>I hate falling in to the trap of what could&rsquo;ve/should&rsquo;ve, but lets entertain Andy&rsquo;s thoughts for a little bit. IF this licensing scheme had taken off, JBoss had a few choices:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Include those libraries AND their attribution. He&rsquo;s right, this would&rsquo;ve made for a really ugly web application.</p></li>
<li><p> Sign agreements with the underlying component authors to remove the atributions.</p></li>
<li><p> Find another package that does the same thing and doesn&rsquo;t require attribution.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So there it is&hellip; is choice diminished? Is the code any less &ldquo;open&rdquo; and free? Is its redistribution negated? Nope. Take his mention of Alfresco&hellip; They require attribution, so what are my choices if I want to bundle Alfresco with my web application?</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Build a competing product, myself.</p></li>
<li><p> Sign an agreement with them for attribution removal.</p></li>
<li><p> Find another JCR-compliant DMS. (Magnolia, Nuxeo, Jackrabbit, etc&hellip;)</p></li>
<li><p> Include the atribution.</p></li>
<li><p> Go cry on <a href="http://www.theserverside.com">TSS</a> about their licensing.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I do agree, in this scenario, that badgeware licenses <em>may</em> affect adoption of a product. People still have choice, and most, will likely choose the free options rather than the costly ones. However, its a calculated move by these companies, as they are probably betting that those who choose to sign agreements will offset the lost revenue of those who went elsewhere. My own opinion on attribution licenses is that they will slow down adoption and decrease market share. Is that a price worth paying? Apparently some of these companies think so.</p>

<p>Next, in Andy&rsquo;s rant&hellip; err&hellip; rebuttal&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;you guys are potentially creating a class software that can&rsquo;t be aggregated
together even under the same license! A class of software that you wouldn&rsquo;t use
in your product for practical reasons (every screen has millions of pixels
dedicated to ads). You want to call that open source?? Get real! (BTW none of
their licenses have been approved by OSI YET)</p></blockquote>

<p>This software can be aggregated just as before. The one clause in many of these licenses is that I must display some attribution in some part of my app (this differs from license to license). So it may appear distasteful to you, Andy, to add the attribution in your application, but guess what? It may also be distasteful for some to bundle their applications with MySQL, being GPL. So what does MySQL offer? A commercial license!</p>

<p>Andy, being Andy, does a good job at self-promotion at the end of his blog about his company <a href="http://www.buni.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page">BuniSoft</a> and its product, <a href="http://buni.org/mediawiki/index.php/Meldware_Communications_Suite">MeldWare</a>. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair if I didn&rsquo;t mention that his product does compete with <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/">Zimbra</a>, which just happens to have its own license, <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/license/zimbra_public_license_1.2.html">ZPL</a>, which just happens to have an attribution clause. Imagine that! ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>STAY METAL!
