<div class="entry-content"><p>How much should an entrepreneur make once his company is sold? What percentage of equity is &ldquo;fair&rdquo; for founders to hold on to? Personally, I despise the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo;, because it always leads to some bed-wetting liberal socialist ideal of what they deem to be &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;just&rdquo;. Why I ask these questions, is due to the meandering and degraded <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=44211">thread on TSS, regarding Marc Fleury leaving Red Hat</a>, and what was a &ldquo;fair&rdquo; amount of equity he and his family should&rsquo;ve kept.</p>

<p>Anyone that has ever tried to start/build/market his own startup, fully realizes how much risk, sleepless nights, knots-in-stomach, overwhelming stress, etc&hellip; are associated with such an endeavor. A founder absorbs 100% of the risk in the early stages, often going without pay, insurance for himself and family, and simply living life trying to fulfill a dream. This is why most of us stick to working for &ldquo;the man&rdquo; where a paycheck and benefits are assured, because we simply don&rsquo;t have the stomach for it. Its that point, that many of the incessant little whiners on TSS seem to overlook, or simply have never experienced. Whether Marc Fleury walked away with two dollars or a hundred million dollars, is not my problem. At the end of the day, what matters, is what <em>I</em> got out of JBoss, because at the end of the day, its all about me. ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>Clearly, the whiners on TSS feel the same way. Don&rsquo;t let them fool you with their march against &ldquo;the evil corporate greed monster&rdquo;. No, many of these guys are angry, because they weren&rsquo;t part of the equity-event &ndash; or didn&rsquo;t receive their &ldquo;fair share&rdquo; (waah!). In fact, most of these clowns decided long ago to leave JBoss and launch a competing product, even while wearing their red floppy shoes. As Bill Burke put it, it was a coupe. Would you reward half a dozen employees of yours that decided to fork off and launch a competing product? Specially, during the most critical times of a startup? I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I would move to crush them like little grapes.</p>

<p>So that leads me to what everyone &ldquo;got&rdquo; out of JBoss, ignoring for a minute the peanut gallery throwing their boogers at Marc. Many of us didn&rsquo;t make enough to retire &ndash; clearly, most of us are still working. What JBoss did for the industry was prove that OSS was able to compete toe-to-toe with commercial vendors, and further proved that the business model was viable. So what do we have now? Alfresco, Mule, Sugar, and others, all emulating (in some form or fashion) the JBoss model. What does that mean for you? More jobs, more growth, more success, and hell&hellip; maybe even turning your own OSS project in to something that makes money! In this respect, the whiners should be thanking Marc for putting OSS on the map, as it will, in turn, benefit their own projects (These guys are a bit too shortsighted to see that, however).</p>

<p>For me, there is something more important than immediate cash benefits. There are also intangible benefits to the entire JBoss story for those working here. JBoss projects were, and still are, mostly controlled by their project leads. For our own Portal project, we didn&rsquo;t just sit around coding all day like a bunch of cube-farm coders (I&rsquo;d kill myself) taking orders from some clueless architect. No, among other things, we were responsible for marketing, evangelizing, answering support cases, delivering and writing the training materials and certification exams, interfacing with customers/partners/analysts, etc&hellip; Essentially, we are a business within a business. This is not only empowering to the project developers but it also exposed them to areas outside of &ldquo;the code&rdquo;. From my point of view, in my 2+ years here, I&rsquo;ve learned the marketing/sales side of the software business better than any MBA could hope to, from some windbag professor. (Some studies show that getting an MBA makes your dumber, but anyway&hellip;)</p>

<p>So what was my net benefit working at JBoss? Not only did I put a little cash in my pocket, but more importantly, Fleury taught us all how to run a successful software business. You can let that bake your noodle all you want, but I don&rsquo;t think <em>anyone</em> can put a price tag on that sort of experience. When I could&rsquo;ve sat in a cube and worked at some bottomless pit of a corporation, I chose rather to work at JBoss, and I am much wiser for it. So not for the immediate cash, but for my future career potential, do I thank Marc for working things the way he did. What <em>I</em> learned here at JBoss, no one can ever take from me and likely will have a severe positive impact on my future income potential. However, another tenth of a percentage point of equity, would&rsquo;ve just meant nicer rims on my car. Which would you choose?</p>

<p>STAY METAL!
