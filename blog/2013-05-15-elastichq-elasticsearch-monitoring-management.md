As a long-time user of ElasticSearch, I&rsquo;m proud to announce a new project I&rsquo;ve undertaken, <a href="http://www.elastichq.org">ElasticHQ</a> &ndash; an <a href="http://www.elastichq.org">ElasticSearch Management and Monitoring</a> solution that is 100% browser-based, ie. No software to install.

Those who know me, would note that this is a departure from my usual style of coding and architecture, but after studying the ElasticSearch Java API (mainly TransportClient), I decided it would spur mass adoption if the application was run on the client (browser). So using Backbone.js, Underscore.js, Twitter Bootstrap, and Flot charts, I managed to carve out a solid nucleus I can build upon.

Feel free to check it out here: <a href="http://www.elastichq.org">ElasticHQ.org</a>

For those that want to look at the code, you can find it on Github, under <a href="https://github.com/royrusso/elasticsearch-HQ">ElasticSearch-HQ</a>. There is also a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/elastichq">Google Group</a>, although not advertised yet.
