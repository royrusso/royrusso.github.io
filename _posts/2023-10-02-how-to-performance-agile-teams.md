## Introduction

We've recently started adding new features to NitroIQ that help you identify performance issues in JIRA, and provide you with actionable insights to help you resolve them.

To that end, we are adding an entirely new section of best-practices and help to the NitroIQ online documentation. The aim is to help team leaders identify performance issues in their teams and processes and provide them with prescriptive guidance, using their own data, on how to resolve them.

The first two articles in this series are:

- [Diagnosing Issue Churn](https://nitroiq.io/docs/how_to/diagnosing_issue_churn/)
- [Backlog Maintenance](https://nitroiq.io/docs/how_to/backlog_maintenance/)

Both of these articles are issues that NitroIQ actively helps customers with today. We are simply making the process more intuitive with step-by-step instructions and screenshots.

_NitroIQ is a tool that helps you identify performance issues in JIRA. It's free to use for up to 10 users. [Sign up for NitroIQ](https://nitroiq.io) and start identifying performance issues in JIRA today._
